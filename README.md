# Weather App Redo

Now that I'm more experienced using React, I decided I would go back and make changes/improvements to my weather app. There is still much work to do, however future improvements are in the works!

### Using Axios

Previously, I was using fetch to call the API. WITHOUT async/await. Huge mistake. It explains why sometimes the data wouldn't show up.

### useContext

Here I implemented useContext so I could get rid of prop-drilling. Now, child components can access the context data without parent components re-rendering.

### FontAwesome React Icons

Previously, 

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
